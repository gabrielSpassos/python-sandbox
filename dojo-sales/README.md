# Sales Dojo

A retailer is having a sales "buy and get the cheapest one free". But for legal reasons you cannot create a invoice with the product with the value 0.

So you must divide equally the discount need in all the products that this customer is buying. Create a function to calculate this equally.

input: [{name:'', amount:""},{}] output: List with items (FinalValue, discount %, discount amount)

## Usage

* Run unit tests

```shell
python3 -m unittest -v test_main.py
```
